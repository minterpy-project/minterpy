============================
Contributing to the Codebase
============================

If you're making changes to the Minterpy codebase (excluding its documentation),
please review the following guidelines and conventions:

- :doc:`code-style`: Ensure your code adheres to the established style guidelines.
- :doc:`pre-commits`: Follow the pre-commit configuration to check the code
  for syntax, formatting, and style errors.
- :doc:`running-writing-tests`: Familiarize yourself with the testing framework
  used in the Minterpy project and the convention used when writing new tests
  to verify your changes.

While the first two points may be discussed during a merge request,
the last point is non-negotiable; all the tests--old and new--must pass.
